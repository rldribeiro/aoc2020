            //
            // After saving Christmas five years in a row, you've decided to take a vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go on without you.
            //
            // The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only.The gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish;
            // the locals just call them stars.
            // None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them, but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive
            // so you can pay the deposit on your room.
            // 
            // To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.
            // 
            // Collect stars by solving puzzles.
            // Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
